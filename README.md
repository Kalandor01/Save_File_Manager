This module allows a basic (save) file creation, loading and deletion interface, with (open source) secure encoding.  
It also has a function for a displaying basic UI elements.
Use 'save_name = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) + "/save*"' as the save name to save files in the current directory instead of the default path.
